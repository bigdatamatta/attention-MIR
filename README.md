# attention-MIR

This is the code for my KDD paper 2019 in the applied data science track (under review).

The current notebook file is an initial commit and cleaned up .py files will be added up later. I will also add up a requirements.txt file
so you can set up a similar python environment. 

For now, the notebook should be bug free and work just fine. Feel free to ask me any questions.
