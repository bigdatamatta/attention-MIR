# attention-MIR

This is the code for my KDD 2019 workshop paper.

The current notebook file is an initial commit and cleaned up .py files will be added. I will also add up a requirements.txt file
so you can set up a similar python environment. This will all be done after my paper has been examined by the KDD reviewers (28th April 2019). 

In the meantime, if you happen to stumble upon this work, the provided notebook should be bug free and work just fine and. Feel free to ask me any questions.
